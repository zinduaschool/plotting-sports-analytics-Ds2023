# SPORTS ANALYTICS

Data Driven frameworks should drive decisions in the field, court or pitches in the same way they influence decisions in the boardroom.
And many sports enthusiasts are showing the power of analytics in sports science, 
from IBMs involvement in facilitating F1 teams to analysis of track injuries data for improving participants’ safety, 
the gains cannot be overstated. 

Individuals who think critically and understand complex problems through data exploration do bring a unique perspective 
to the investigation of player movements and interactions in sports

In this project you will explore the tour de france data.

The Tour de France is an annual men's multiple stage bicycle race primarily held in France, while also occasionally 
passing through nearby countries. Like the other Grand Tours (the Giro d'Italia and the Vuelta a España), it consists 
of 21 day-long stages over the course of 23 days. It has been described as "the world’s most prestigious and most difficult bicycle race".

You will explore the following with the supplied [data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-04-07/tdf_winners.csv) 
- The winning time and how far the runner up is, i.e. how long did it take to win, with every edition. So in a sense 
checking, are there cyclist getting better bikes, or are they getting lazier
- A box plot of the winners per stage type and comment sth. Use this [image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EVffsa7XQAEpMEl?format=png&name=900x900) as inspiration 
- What relationship is there between a winners age and the number of stages led. 
- Sort by the most recent winning and find the winner's nationality and display the top. Use this [image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EVmLOCwWAAUhHL8?format=png&name=900x900) as inspiration 
 
It is important to note that poor communication creates confusion and potentially even doubt in the minds of business leaders 
who are tasked with decision-making and as such I urge you to be as expressive as possible in presenting your insights.
